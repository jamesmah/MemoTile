# memotile

##Instructions
A readme.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

###Goal
A two player game which allows for customisable tokens and board size.
I picked a tile based game system that was simpler than checkers
but different from tictactoe and would make more sense to scale the grid size.

###Technologies used
HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery (& jQuery effects!)

###Approach taken
Built html document with 
Built the responsive layout first (lots of divs)
  Used 3 media queries for 4 different aspect ratio ranges
  Used lots of vh, vm
  Would be useful if there was an aspect ratio lock for divs
Built 

Added icon, audio



hover does not work on the first item on grid

transition is nice :D

there's some bugs in the mouse transition from red to blue and back

the hovering doesn't really work well on mobile

move mouse really fast the slide ins can get stuck too

not all media queries really work with safari

jquery really helped shorten the amount of code,
no need for while loops
